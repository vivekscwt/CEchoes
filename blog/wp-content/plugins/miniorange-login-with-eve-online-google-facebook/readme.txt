= WordPress Single Sign-On / SSO ( Login to WordPress ) =

WordPress Single Sign-On (WordPress SSO) allows users to log into any website/application using the single set of credentials of another app/site.
**Example:** Let's say you have all your users/customers/members/employees stored on a site (eg. Microsoft Azure AD, Azure B2C, Gmail, WordPress, AWS Cognito, Keycloak, etc.), called 'site A' and you want all of them to register/login to your WordPress site called 'site B'. In this scenario, you can register/login all your users of site A into site B using the login credentials/account of site A. This is called Single Sign-On or SSO.

= WordPress Single Sign-On ( WordPress SSO ) supported Third-Party Application / OAuth OpenID Provider =
* The Third-Party Application can be anything where user accounts are stored or a site/application where you want to store/migrate all the users. It can be your social login app, WordPress site, custom provider, or any database.
* Applications/providers include OAuth Identity Provider, OAuth Server, OpenID Connect Server, OpenID Connect Provider, OIDC Provider, OIDC Server, OAuth Application, OpenID Connect Application, OIDC Application, OpenID Connect Server, OpenID Connect Provider, OpenID Connect Application.

OAuth and OpenID Connect are token-based Single Sign-On (SSO) protocols that allow an end user's account information to be used by third-party services without exposing the user's password.

Along with OAuth 2.0, the SSO plugin also has support for OAuth 1.0 and OAuth 2.1 protocols. And, we support the latest OAuth and OpenID Connect protocol including secure 2-Factor Authentication (2FA), and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) if enabled at the OAuth/OpenID provider's end.


= WordPress Single Sign-On ( WordPress SSO ) USE CASES =

* Single Sign On (SSO) between 2 WordPress sites (Login with WordPress):
	1. Single Sign On (SSO) to a WordPress site (single/multisite) using User Credentials stored on another WordPress site
	2. Single Sign On (SSO) to one/multiple WordPress sites (or subsites) using User Credentials stored on another WordPress site
* Single Sign On (SSO) into WordPress with Any OAuth / OpenID Connect (OIDC) application (Login with Social Login Apps / Custom Providers):
	1. Single Sign On (SSO) to one WordPress site (single / multisite) using User Credentials stored on your third-party application
	2. Single Sign On (SSO) to one/multiple WordPress sites (or subsites) using User Credentials stored on another WordPress site
* Single Sign On into WordPress using existing User stores (Active Directory/Database)
* SSO and extended plugin functionality using tokens (access_token / JWT token / id_token) such as secure API calls using third-party token
* Others: eCommerce Single Sign On (SSO)/Login & other third-party integration with SSO features
